  <h2> Project 1: Predict Maintenance Step for Flight Simulator </h2>
  </p>
    Predict the maintenance step for the inverter of the FlightMax Fill Motion Simulator using its coordinate positions in the x, y, and z directions. The steps are broken down into 13 individual steps where the feature variables are the x, y, and z coordinates and the target variable is the maintenance step number the coordinates align to.

  <h2> Project 2: Classify Crack Sizes for Aerospace Material </h2>
  <p>
    The focus of this project is to detect cracks from a fatigue test and classify them based on a set of four labels: large, medium, small, and none. A deep convolutional neural network will be implemented for image recognition where provided crack images are classified based on the aforementioned labels and a trained model will provide its prediction of the image’s classification.

  <h2> Project 3: Streamline PCB Verification Process </h2>
  <p>
  The focus of this project is on the implementation of computer vision on printed circuit boards, specifically motherboards, Arduino’s, and Raspberry Pi’s, to detect components using image data of components that compose these boards. The result of this process is a highly streamlined and accurate method of ensuring successful board component installation.
